# Stone

Notes, tasks, and a calendar over plain markdown files.

The premise: a note, a task, and an event are all just things that do or do not
sit on a date. Obsidian treats the calendar as a plugin afterthought; Notion can
model time but only inside slow cloud databases. Stone keeps all three in one
place, on top of files you own.

Everything is a `.md` file in a folder you choose. Open that folder in Obsidian,
VS Code, or a text editor and it reads exactly the same. There is no database,
no proprietary format, and nothing to export.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # development, with hot reload
npm run build        # bundle main, preload, and renderer
npm run typecheck    # tsc over both projects
```

Packaging:

```bash
npm run dist:win     # NSIS installer, x64 + arm64
npm run dist:mac     # universal DMG — compiles, signs, and verifies the signature
npm run verify:mac   # re-check an already-built dmg or an installed .app
```

`dist:mac` refuses to build without a signing certificate, because an unsigned
macOS build takes the user's calendar permission with it: macOS pins a privacy
grant to the app's code signature, and with no certificate to anchor to it pins
to the binary itself, so the next update silently revokes the access the last
one was granted. Create one — it is self-signed and takes a second — with:

```bash
npm run signing-cert                      # once, per machine
./scripts/make-signing-cert.sh --export   # print the secrets CI needs
```

Releases are built by `.github/workflows/release.yml` on a `v*` tag, and must
sign with that **same** certificate, so it is worth setting the two repository
secrets that `--export` prints. A self-signed certificate keeps the calendar
grant alive but does not clear Gatekeeper; that needs an Apple Developer ID and
notarisation, which `scripts/sign-mac.mjs` picks up automatically if the
keychain has one.

## How it stores things

### Tasks

A task is a markdown checkbox. Write one in any note and it appears in the Tasks
view and on the calendar:

```markdown
- [ ] Finish the parser @2026-08-12 14:30 ~2026-08-10 !high +90m #compilers
```

| Token | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `@2026-08-12` | Due date, optionally with a `HH:MM` time |
| `~2026-08-10` | Scheduled — when you plan to work on it |
| `!urgent` `!high` `!medium` `!low` | Priority |
| `+90m` `+2h` `+1d` | Estimate |
| `#tag` | Tag |

Status comes from the checkbox: `[ ]` todo, `[/]` in progress, `[x]` done,
`[-]` cancelled. Obsidian Tasks emoji syntax (📅 ⏳ ⏫ 🔺 🔽 ✅) is read on import,
but Stone always writes the token form.

### Events

A note becomes an event when its frontmatter gives it a date **and a time**:

```markdown
---
date: 2026-08-09
start: "17:00"
end: "17:30"
location: Anywhere quiet
---
```

Quote the times. `gray-matter` parses frontmatter with js-yaml 3, which still
follows the YAML 1.1 sexagesimal rule — an unquoted `17:00` becomes the integer
1020. Stone compensates for this when reading, but quoting keeps the file
unambiguous for every other tool.

A bare `date:` only files the note under that day. Without that rule every daily
note would become an all-day event and bury the real calendar.

### Links

`[[Wikilinks]]` resolve by filename or title, and each note lists its backlinks.
Renaming a note rewrites every link that pointed at it.

A link or an embed can name part of a note rather than the whole of it:

| Write | Gets you |
| --- | --- |
| `[[Note#Heading]]` | A link that scrolls to that heading |
| `![[Note#Heading]]` | That heading's section, embedded in place |
| `![[Note#Heading#Sub]]` | Just the subsection |
| `![[Note#^block-id]]` | The one paragraph carrying that `^block-id` |

A section runs from its heading to the next heading at the same level or above.
Rename the heading and the embed says it cannot find the section rather than
quietly widening to the whole page — a silent wrong answer being worse than a
loud missing one. The same slicing is used on screen and in the PDF export.

## Calendar integration

Stone reads four sources and merges them into one view.

| Source | Platform | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vault notes and tasks | Both | Parsed from frontmatter and checkboxes |
| Apple Calendar | macOS | EventKit through a JXA bridge — read and write |
| Outlook / Windows Calendar | Both | Microsoft Graph, device-code sign-in — read and write |
| Any ICS feed | Both | Subscribed by URL, read-only, cached for 10 minutes |

**ICS is the zero-configuration path** and works immediately on both platforms.
Google Calendar publishes a secret iCal address under Settings › Integrate
calendar; Outlook has one under Settings › Shared calendars. Paste it into
Settings › Subscribe to a calendar.

**Apple Calendar** is driven through EventKit rather than by scripting
Calendar.app, because Apple Events are slow enough to make a year-wide query
visibly stall. macOS asks for calendar permission the first time.

Since macOS 14 that permission comes in two grades, and only **full access** can
read events — write-only lets Stone add an event but shows you an empty
calendar. Stone asks for full access and names the difference if it only has the
lesser one; if you see that message, switch it under System Settings › Privacy &
Security › Calendars.

**Microsoft Graph** needs a client ID from your own free Azure app registration
(public client, `Calendars.ReadWrite` scope). Stone deliberately does not ship a
shared one: that would put every install behind a single quota and a single
revocation. The refresh token is stored through Electron's `safeStorage`, so it
sits in the OS keychain rather than in a plain file.

## Sync

Stone does not implement a sync protocol. The vault lives inside a folder that
iCloud Drive, Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive is already replicating, and the
first-run screen detects those folders for you.

What Stone does instead is make writes safe for that arrangement:

- **Atomic writes.** Every save goes to a temp file, is flushed with `fsync`,
  then renamed over the target. A sync client can never observe a half-written
  note.
- **Conflict copies.** Saves carry a content hash of the version that was read.
  If the file on disk no longer matches, the remote version is preserved as
  `Note (conflict 2026-08-06T12-30-00).md` before writing. Nothing is
  overwritten silently.
- **Debounced watching.** Sync engines rewrite files in bursts, so every path is
  debounced and settled before reindexing.
- **Deletes go to `.trash`** inside the vault, not to `unlink`.
- **Version history, in two tiers.** Every save that changes a note archives the
  version it replaced. `.stone/snapshots` keeps a rolling 25 per note and can be
  switched off in settings; `.stone/backups` keeps every one of them
  permanently, is never pruned, and cannot be switched off. Both stores name a
  version by the same timestamp, so the history panel shows one row per version
  and marks the permanent ones `kept`.
- **Backups are immutable.** Each backup is written once under a name that is
  never reused and then chmod'd `0444`. No save, rename, delete, or plugin can
  write inside `.stone/backups` — the vault refuses the path outright rather
  than failing halfway through. The archive only ever grows; pruning it is a
  deliberate act you take from a shell, not something Stone can do to you.

For iCloud, turn off "Optimise Mac Storage" for the vault folder; for Drive and
OneDrive, mark it available offline. Stone skips `.icloud` placeholder stubs, but
an evicted file is a file it cannot read.

## Keyboard

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl/Cmd K` | Search everything, or run a command |
| `Ctrl/Cmd J` | Quick-add a task from anywhere |
| `Ctrl/Cmd T` | Jump to today |
| `Ctrl/Cmd N` | New note |
| `Ctrl/Cmd 1-8` | Today, Notes, Calendar, Tasks, Graph, Views, Canvas, Documents |
| `Ctrl/Cmd B` `I` | Bold, italic |
| `Ctrl/Cmd Shift M` | Highlight |
| `Ctrl/Cmd Shift 8` | Bullet list |
| `Tab` `Alt ↑↓` | Nest a list item, move one (with its children) |
| `Ctrl/Cmd Enter` | Turn the line into a task, or cycle its status |
| `Ctrl/Cmd Shift Enter` | Run the code block the cursor is in |

Every one of those is rebindable. Settings › Keyboard lists each command with the
chords bound to it; click one to remove it, or record another. A command can
answer to several, and a chord bound twice is called out rather than silently
resolved. Bindings are stored by command id, so they survive an update.

## Capture

Quick-add used to answer only when Stone had focus, which is the moment you are
least likely to need it. Three routes now bring it in from outside:

- a **global shortcut** — `Ctrl/Cmd Shift Space` by default, rebindable, and it
  says so plainly if another app already owns the combination;
- a **menu-bar icon**, so capture survives the window being closed;
- **`stone://` links** — `stone://capture?text=…`, `stone://open?path=…`,
  `stone://daily` — which any script or app can fire.

### The web clipper

Turn it on in Settings › Capture and Stone listens on `127.0.0.1` for pages sent
from the browser. Copy the bookmarklet it gives you into a bookmark; clicking it
on any page sends your selection, or the whole article when nothing is selected,
into your clippings folder as markdown with the source URL in frontmatter.

That is an inbound socket in an app that otherwise has none, so it is fenced in:
off unless you turn it on, bound to loopback so nothing off the machine can
reach it, and every request carries a secret only your bookmarklet knows —
because any page in your browser can reach a localhost port, and the token is
what separates yours from a site that guessed the number. Reissue it whenever
you like; the old bookmarklet stops working.

## Formatting

Highlight any text and a formatting bar appears over it, the way Obsidian's
does: bold, italic, strikethrough, `==highlight==`, inline code, a link or a
`[[wikilink]]`, heading levels, quote, list, and task — plus **Tx** to strip
inline markup back out.

Every button is a toggle and shows its state, so pressing bold on text that is
already bold unwraps it rather than nesting a second pair of asterisks. The bar
waits for the pointer to come up before it appears, so it never chases a drag,
and `Esc` dismisses it without losing the selection.

The **&#9679;** button opens a row of colours — seven as ink, the same seven as
a highlight behind the words, and a crossed-out swatch on each row to take the
colour off again. Colour is written as `<span style="color: #e05252">` and
`<mark style="background: #…">`, which is the HTML Obsidian, GitHub and Stone's
own exporter all understand, so a coloured note keeps its colour outside Stone.
The palette is mid-tone ink and translucent washes on purpose: a note is read in
both themes, and a colour picked against white and read against near-black has
to clear both grounds.

### Marks markdown never grew

| Write | Gets you |
| --- | --- |
| `==text==` | A yellow highlight |
| `<u>text</u>` | Underline |
| `<sup>2</sup>` | Superscript — x&sup2;, a citation marker |
| `<sub>2</sub>` | Subscript — H&#8322;O, an index |
| `^[an aside]` | An inline footnote, numbered where it sits |
| `%%private%%` | A comment: in the file, never in the export |

CommonMark leaves underline, superscript and subscript out and expects the HTML
instead, so the tag *is* the markdown here. Each hides its own tags until the
caret reaches the line.

Footnotes work both ways round: `[^1]` with a definition further down, and
`^[the note itself, here]` for the one you would otherwise never bother to
write. Both print as a numbered marker and a note in a list at the foot of the
document.

A comment can span lines — `%%` alone on a line opens one, the next `%%` closes
it. Commented text is dimmed rather than hidden, because this is an editor and
text that vanishes when the caret leaves is text you will be surprised by later.
What it never reaches is a PDF, an HTML export, the Tasks view or the calendar:
commenting a task out really does park it.

Type `:` and a word for emoji — `:tada:`, `:rocket:`, `:warning:`. What lands in
the file is the character, never the shortcode.

### Callouts

```markdown
> [!warning]- Collapsible, and starts collapsed
> The `-` after the kind makes a callout fold. `+` makes it foldable
> but leaves it open.
```

`[!note]`, `[!tip]`, `[!warning]`, `[!danger]`, `[!quote]`, `[!success]`,
`[!bug]` and `[!example]` each have their own tint and glyph. Callouts nest: a
`> >` line inside one opens a second panel held by the first, drawn inset with
its own tint rather than stacking a second wash over the first — two washes
multiplied together read as a shade of the outer panel, not as a panel.

### Contents

````markdown
```toc
levels: 2-3
```
````

The note's own headings, listed where the block sits and clickable. Built from
the document every time it is drawn, so it cannot go stale: rename a heading and
the contents follow. `levels:` defaults to `2-6`, because in a note with a title
an `h1` is usually the title said twice.

### Code blocks

Every fenced block is topped by a bar naming its language, with a **Copy**
button on the right. The bar stands in for the ```` ``` ```` line rather than
sitting above it — that line was always there, and this only draws it as a label
instead of as syntax. The backticks come back when the caret lands on it.

Typing inside one suggests names. Three sources, in the order they are worth
having: what the block itself declares, what the blocks above it in the same
language declared — the session they all run into, which is the thing nothing
else on the page tells you — and then the language's own keywords and builtins.
It is not a language server and does not pretend to be: the declarations are
read off the source the way the **Code** inspector reads them, and a suggestion
after a `.` is a common method rather than a checked one. A note is twenty lines
of Python in a page of prose, not a repository, and that is the honest size of
the answer.

A `!` in front of the language turns suggestions off for that one block:

````markdown
```!python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```
````

The mark means nothing else. The block still highlights, still runs, still gets
its header bar — because "stop guessing at what I am typing" and "this is not
Python" are different requests, and only the first one is being made.
Transcribing a listing out of a book is the case it exists for.

### Maths

`$x$` is an inline equation and `$$` on its own line opens a display one, both
rendered by KaTeX. Inside either, `\` opens a menu of LaTeX commands with the
symbol each one draws beside its name, and the selected one rendered beside the
list — because nobody remembers whether "much less than" is `\ll` or `\lll`,
they remember the shape. Searching matches what a symbol *is* as well as what it
is called, so `union`, `fraction` and `much less` all find theirs.

Commands arrive complete. `\frac` puts the caret in the numerator, `\left(`
brings its `\right)` along, and `\begin{` offers whole environments —
`aligned`, `cases`, `pmatrix` — already closed, with a row of `&` showing where
the columns go.

### Lists

A list is drawn on a grid rather than on its own indentation. Whatever is in the
file — two spaces, four, a tab — is what stays in the file; what appears on the
page is one fixed step per level, a bullet that changes shape as it nests
(&bull;, &#9702;, &#9642;), a hairline down each ancestor's column, and a hanging
indent so an item that wraps continues under its own text instead of running
back to the margin under its bullet. Numbers keep their own characters, set
flush right so that 9 and 10 line up on the dot.

The raw prefix comes back when the selection reaches into it, and only then.
Clicking into the third word of an item three levels deep does not swap the grid
for eight literal spaces and a hyphen — that would jump the line, and everything
under it, sideways for markup nobody was about to edit. Arrow left from the
start of the text and the marker appears, whole and editable.

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Tab` / `Shift Tab` | Nest the item under the one above, or lift it back out |
| `Alt ↑` / `Alt ↓` | Move the item past its neighbour |
| `Ctrl/Cmd Shift 8` | Turn the line into a bullet, or back into a paragraph |
| `Ctrl/Cmd Shift H` | Collapse the item, or the section |

Each of those moves the item's children with it, which is the whole difference
between an outline and a stack of lines: nesting a parent nests everything under
it, and moving one leaves nothing orphaned behind. An ordered list is renumbered
afterwards — except one written as `1.` on every line, which is legal CommonMark
and a deliberate style, and is left exactly as it was typed.

An item with children gets a collapse arrow in the margin on hover, and a ring
around its marker while it is closed, so a folded item is visible without
hovering it. Outside a list every one of these keys means what it always did:
`Tab` indents, `Alt ↑` moves the line.

### Hyperlinks

Three routes to `[text](url)`, because the bar only exists once something is
selected:

- **`Ctrl/Cmd Shift K`** wraps the selection, or drops an empty `[]()` with the
  caret in the address. Not `Cmd K` — that is the command palette, and shadowing
  it in the editor is a worse trade than one extra modifier. It *does* shadow
  CodeMirror's own `Cmd Shift K` (delete line), which is the price of the chord.
- **Paste a URL over selected text** and the text becomes the label rather than
  being replaced — the behaviour every other editor has. A paste that is not a
  URL, or over a selection that already contains brackets, is left alone.
- **`/hyperlink`** in the slash menu, for starting one from nothing. `/link to a
  note` is still the `[[wikilink]]` next to it.

Selecting a bare URL and pressing the shortcut makes *it* the target and leaves
the caret in the empty label, which is the order you actually work in when you
paste first and name it afterwards.

### Tables

A table is a grid you type into, not pipes you count. Click any cell and edit it
in place; the markdown underneath is rewritten and **realigned** on every commit,
so the source stays readable in any other editor rather than drifting a
character per keystroke.

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Tab` / `Shift Tab` | Next / previous cell. From the last cell, `Tab` adds a row |
| `Enter` | New row below |
| `Alt Cmd ↓` / `↑` | Add a row below / above |
| `Alt Cmd →` / `←` | Add a column right / left |
| `Alt Cmd ⌫` | Delete this row (`Shift` for the column) |
| `Esc` | Leave the table, back to the note |

Only cells are editable — the header row defines the table's shape, so deleting
it, or the last remaining row or column, is refused rather than silently
producing something that is no longer a table.

Two details that are load-bearing rather than decorative. A cell shows rendered
markup until you put the caret in it and its own markdown once you do, because
typing against text that re-renders under the caret is worse than seeing the
asterisks. And the document is written on boundaries — blur, `Tab`, `Enter`, a
structural key — never on each keystroke, since a write rebuilds the table and
would pull the node out from under the caret. A cell edit and the row it
triggers are one write, so `Tab` off the last cell is one undo step.

Hovering the table puts a small &#8676; on each header cell: click it to cycle
that column through left, centre and right. It writes the colons in the rule row
and re-pads every cell to match, so the file says what the page shows. If a cell
is mid-edit the alignment change composes with it into a single write, the way
every other structural change here does.

A malformed rule row and an escaped pipe can still only be fixed in the source,
so **Markdown** on the table's top-right corner (on hover) drops it back to raw
text. Move the caret out of the table to return to the grid.

## Architecture

```
src/
  shared/          types and the task syntax parser, used by both processes
  main/
    vault/         indexer, file watcher, atomic writes, link graph
    calendar/      macOS EventKit bridge, Microsoft Graph, ICS, merge service
    cloud.ts       detects iCloud/Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive folders
    ipc.ts         every channel, each returning {ok, data} or {ok, error}
  preload/         the only bridge; contextIsolation on, nodeIntegration off
  renderer/        React 19, Zustand, CodeMirror 6
```

The renderer never touches the filesystem. Paths crossing IPC are checked
against the vault root, so a crafted `..` cannot escape it, and the renderer
runs under a CSP that blocks network access entirely — nothing in the UI needs
it.

The editor is CodeMirror 6 with live-preview decorations: syntax markers are
hidden while the caret is elsewhere and revealed the moment it enters the line.
The document itself is never rewritten, so what you edit is exactly what is on
disk. Frontmatter folds to a row of property names, because raw `---` fences are
noise on a page you are reading.

## Graph

The Graph view plots every note as a node and every resolved `[[wikilink]]` as
an edge. Node size follows link count; hovering isolates a note and its
neighbours; the search box highlights matches without hiding context. Click a
node to open it, drag to reposition, scroll to zoom.

It is a canvas with a small force simulation written by hand — no physics
library, because d3-force would roughly double the renderer bundle for one
screen. Repulsion uses a uniform spatial grid rather than comparing every pair,
so cost stays near-linear instead of the O(n²) that makes naive versions stall
past a few hundred notes. The layout cools and stops rather than spinning
forever, and the view auto-frames once it has settled.

## Databases

A view is a saved query with a shape — table, board, gallery, list, timeline —
over the notes you already have. The rows are notes, the columns are frontmatter
keys Stone inferred a type for.

Views also **write back**. Drag a card between board columns and it rewrites that
note's grouping property; edit a table cell and it edits one line of YAML,
leaving the rest of the file byte-identical. **New** creates a note that already
satisfies the view's filters, so it does not vanish the moment it is created.
Columns that describe the file rather than live in it — `folder`, `edited` — stay
read-only, because you change those by moving or editing the note.

### Relations and rollups

A `[[link]]` in a frontmatter property is a *typed* link: the key says what the
relationship is.

```markdown
---
project: "[[Website rebuild]]"
---
```

Both notes then show it in the Relations panel — outward, and inward on the note
being pointed at, which is the half nobody writes by hand. A project note never
lists its own tasks, and that incoming list is what you actually want.

A **rollup** column follows one of those relations and summarises the far side:
count, sum, average, min, max, earliest, latest, or a list. "Open tasks per
project" is a rollup over the incoming `project` relation.

Write the value quoted. `project: [[X]]` unquoted is a nested sequence in YAML,
not a string — Stone reads both, but the quoted form is what every other tool
will understand.

## Queries inside notes

A ```` ```stone ```` block is a live query, rendered where you wrote it:

```stone
from: Projects
where: status is active
sort: edited desc
as: list
limit: 10
```

or naming a view you already saved:

```stone
view: Active projects
```

`from`, `source` (`notes` or `tasks`), `where`, `sort`, `group`, `columns`, `as`,
and `limit`. The syntax is `key: value` lines because that is the same shape as
the frontmatter above it, it stays readable in any other editor, and a typo
produces one wrong line rather than swallowing the query.

This is what makes a daily note assemble itself. It is always a lens — a query
block never writes.

## Running code blocks

A fenced block in a language Stone knows how to run gets a Run button under it,
and `Ctrl/Cmd Shift Enter` runs the one the cursor is in. Output appears below
the block as it is printed — stdout in the body colour, stderr in red — with the
exit status and how long it took. Stop kills it. Nothing is written back into
the note: a run is something you did to the file, not an edit of it, so the
markdown on disk stays exactly what you typed.

JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Lua, R,
Go, Rust, C, C++, Swift and Java ship with a command. Each one is a single shell
line in Settings › Code, so a machine with pyenv, a project that wants `bun`
instead of `node`, or a language nothing here lists is one field to fill in:

| Placeholder | Is |
| --- | --- |
| `{file}` | the block, written to a scratch file |
| `{dir}` | the folder that file sits in |
| `{name}` | its base name, for compilers that emit a binary |

Java is three things in one fence, so Stone reads the block before running it.
A block with a `main` is a program: it goes through the source-file launcher,
which needs no `javac` step and leaves no class files behind, and on Java 25
that includes a compact source file — a bare `void main()` with no class around
it. The launcher picks the class by file name, so the scratch file is named
after whichever type declares `main` and the entry point need not be the first
thing you wrote; a block declaring a package is compiled and started by its
qualified name instead, that being the one thing the launcher will not do.

A block with no `main` is not a program, and notes are full of those. Where it
is only declarations — a couple of classes off a slide — it is compiled: the
errors are the point, and it says plainly that nothing ran. Where statements sit
loose among the declarations, the way a textbook example puts a class next to
the lines that exercise it, it is a script, and jshell runs it. Your block is
written out untouched either way. Two things follow from jshell being a REPL:
it does not echo the value of an expression loaded from a file, so print what
you want to see, and it reports an error without failing, so a red error and a
zero exit status can appear together.

The block runs through your login shell, which is what lets it find the
interpreters your terminal finds — an app launched from the Finder inherits a
PATH with no nvm, no pyenv and no homebrew in it. It runs in the note's folder,
with your permissions, and it can do anything you can. That is why the first run
asks first: a note is not always something you wrote, and a fenced block in a
clipped web page is a program by a stranger. The answer is remembered, and
Settings › Code takes it back.

Runs stop at a time limit — thirty seconds out of the box — and the whole
process group is killed, so a shell line that spawns something else does not
leave it behind.

### Drawing a Java block's objects

A Java block has a second button: **Diagram**. It runs the block and writes a
[`boxes`](#boxes--what-refers-to-what) figure under it of the objects it left
behind — the variables, what they point at, and what those point at in turn.

The figure is drawn from the objects, not from the source. The block is
compiled and run in a jshell session, and a helper evaluated in that same
session walks what is actually on the heap when it stops. So two variables that
turned out to be the same object come out as one box with two arrows into it,
a list that shares its tail with another shares it on the page, and a cycle is
drawn as a cycle. That is the whole reason to press the button rather than draw
it yourself: the diagram is usually wanted precisely when the aliasing is not
what you think it is.

What becomes a root depends on the shape of the block, the same way running it
does:

| Block | Roots |
| --- | --- |
| Statements, with or without classes | Every variable it declares |
| A class with a `main` | The locals of `main` |

A program's locals only survive to be drawn because the statements of `main`
are run at the top level rather than called — a returned method takes its
locals with it. Its class is still declared, and the nested types and static
helpers beside `main` are offered at the top level too, so `new Node(…)` and
`chain(3)` mean what they meant. What that cannot reach is the class's own
fields: an unqualified `count` in `main` is `Main.count` from outside, and the
error says so.

Arrays, lists, sets and maps are drawn as themselves rather than as their
internals; anything from the platform — a `LocalDate`, a `BigDecimal` — is
drawn as what it prints as, since its seven private fields are not what anyone
means by the date. Big graphs stop at forty objects and say so.

The figure goes into the note, because a figure is part of the file in a way
that a run's output is not: it renders, it prints, it exports, and it opens in
any other editor as the text it is. Pressing Diagram again replaces the one it
wrote last time rather than stacking a second underneath — a `# drawn from the
Java block above` comment is how it knows which is its. Move it, or edit it,
and it is yours: the next press writes a new one and leaves yours alone.

Drawing runs the block, so it is behind the same one-time question the Run
button is, and stops at the same time limit. It needs a JDK — 11 or newer — on
the path your terminal uses.

## Program figures

Eight fences for the pictures a programmer draws on a whiteboard: what refers to
what, what is in memory, what shape a tree is, how a design is put together,
where a key lands, how something grows, which bits a word is cut into, and what
an algorithm does over time. They render in the editor as you type, print into
an export, and are plain text in the file like everything else, so a note that
draws one still reads as source in any other editor.

Mermaid stays the right tool for a flowchart or a state machine. These are for
the things it cannot do: a pointer, a lopsided binary tree, a type hierarchy
that reads like the declarations it came from, a table of buckets with the
collisions worked out, and a sequence of states.

### `memory` — stack, heap, and the pointers between

```memory
title: Reversing a linked list
stack:
  reverse(head):
    prev -> null
    curr -> n2 *
heap:
  n1 Node { val: 1, next: null }
  n2 Node { val: 2, next -> n1 }
  n3 Node { val: 3, next -> n2 }
```

Sections are `stack:`, `heap:` and `globals:`. A box is written one of four
ways:

| Form | Is |
| --- | --- |
| `id Type { field: value, field -> target }` | Named fields, one per row |
| `id Type:` *(fields indented under it)* | The same, when it gets long |
| `id [ a, ->b, . ]` | An array — slots numbered underneath |
| `id ( a, ->b )` | A pair — the same slots, unnumbered |

A slot or a field may point at a box, which is what a bucket table, an adjacency
list and a cons cell are all made of. `-> null` (or `.` in a slot) draws a
struck slot; `-> arr[2]` points at one cell of an array.

**Nothing is positioned.** The heap lays itself out by following its own
pointers: an object nothing points at starts a row, its spine continues that
row, and any other pointer starts a new one. A linked list comes out as a chain
across the page, a tree as a fan, with no coordinates in the source. The spine
is a field called `next`, `cdr`, `tail`, `rest`, `link`, `succ`, `after` or
`down` if there is one, otherwise the last slot of a pair — so a cons cell runs
along and its `car` drops, which is the convention. A pointer that goes
backwards is routed underneath rather than across.

Two one-liners cover the common chains: `list: 1 2 3` builds `Node { val, next }`
boxes, and `pairs: 1 2 3` builds cons cells.

### Cons cells

The pair form is the SICP picture, and `pairs:` gets you one in a line:

```memory
title: (define x (list 1 2 3))
globals:
  x -> p1
pairs: 1 2 3
```

Write the pairs out when the structure is not a flat list — a shared tail, a
cycle, a `car` that is itself a list:

```memory
heap:
  p1 ( ->q1, ->p2 )
  p2 ( 3, . )
  q1 ( 1, ->q2 )
  q2 ( 2, . )
```

### `boxes` — what refers to what

The other thing "box and pointer" means: the object diagram you draw for a Java
or Python program. No stack, no heap, no boundary between them — those are facts
about storage, and this picture is about references.

```boxes
b -> board

board CBoard:
  cells -> grid

grid Int[][] [ ->r0, ->r1 ]

r0 Int[] [ 1, 2, 3 ]
r1 Int[] [ 4, 5, 6 ]
```

Three shapes, and the conventions are fixed rather than optional:

- **A variable** is `name -> target`: a small box with its name outside it,
  because the name is what the box is *called*, not what it holds. `-> null`
  strikes it through, and `name = 5` writes a value in the same little box —
  the `int` a method is holding is as much a part of the picture as the objects
  around it.
- **An object** is `id Type:` with its fields indented, or `id Type { … }` on one
  line. **The title is the type**, centred. The `id` never appears in the
  drawing — it is only how the source wires the arrows up, and in the program
  there is no such name.
- **A list** is `id Type [ … ]`, drawn as a column: type, then **the length**,
  then one row an element. An element is a value or `->target`.

Everything else is shared with `memory` — the same `#red`/`*`/`~` annotations,
the same pointer-following layout, the same errors naming the line. A `stack:`
or `heap:` section is refused here and told to go and be a `memory` block.

Field names are drawn inside their row rather than outside the box, which is the
one place this departs from how the diagram is usually drawn by hand; it keeps a
box self-contained so the layout can move it without dragging labels around.

A pointer to a box that does not exist is an error naming the line, rather than
a silently missing arrow — a diagram where a typo looks like an unset pointer is
worse than no diagram.

A Java block will write one of these for you from the objects it actually
leaves behind — see [Drawing a Java block's objects](#drawing-a-java-blocks-objects).

### `tree` — the shapes that arrive as arrays

```tree
bst: 50 30 70 20 40 60 80
traverse: inorder
```

| Directive | Builds |
| --- | --- |
| `bst: 50 30 70` | Inserts in the order given |
| `heap: 9 7 8 3` | An array as a complete binary tree, indices labelled |
| `level: 1 2 3 . . 4 5` | Level order with `.` for a missing child |
| *(indented outline)* | Anything that is not an array — a parse tree, a trie |

An empty slot is drawn, not omitted, and a parent sits over the midpoint of its
slots rather than its children — so a node with one child leans the way it
should. That is the whole reason not to use a `flowchart` here.

`traverse: inorder` (or `preorder`, `postorder`, `level`) numbers the nodes in
visit order and captions the sequence.

### `tree` — a recurrence, unrolled

```tree
recurrence: 2T(n/2) + n
```

Give it the right-hand side and it draws the recursion tree with what each level
costs down the right, and the sum under a rule. The arithmetic is exact and
symbolic, so mergesort's column reads `n`, `n`, `n`, `n` — which is not a
coincidence to be pointed out afterwards but the visible reason the answer has a
`log n` in it.

| Directive | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `recurrence: 2T(n/2) + n` | Builds the tree and works out the levels |
| `recurrence: T(n-1) + n` | Subtractive: a chain rather than a fan |
| `depth: 4` | Levels below the root — 3, or 2 when it branches wide |
| `cost: n, n/2, n/4` | Write the levels yourself, on any tree |
| `total: Θ(n)` | The line under the rule |

The sum is the master theorem applied, and the case it fell into becomes the
caption: the leaves dominate, the root dominates, or every level costs the same.
Costs are `1`, `n`, `n^2` and multiples of them. A cost with a `log` in it is
refused by name rather than guessed at — `cost:` is how you write those levels
out, and it works on any tree, so a BST or an outline can carry a column too.

### `hash` — a table, with the collisions in it

```hash
buckets: 7
keys: 12 44 13 88 23 94 11
```

This is the one figure the app *computes*. Every other fence draws something you
could point at in your own source; which bucket a key lands in is the answer to
an arithmetic question, and the whole reason for drawing it is that the answer
is not the one you guessed. So you give it the keys and the table size, and it
hashes them, resolves the collisions, and draws what came out — with the load
factor, the longest chain and how much of the table is empty written underneath.

| Directive | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `buckets: 7` | The table size — 8 by default |
| `keys: 12 44 13` | Inserted in this order |
| `probe: chain` | Or `linear`, `quadratic`, `double` — open addressing |
| `hash: mod` | Or `java`, `length`, `first`, `sum`; guessed from the keys |
| `load: 0.75` | Double and rehash when it gets fuller than this |
| `remove: 44` | Deletes — a tombstone, where a probe has to run past it |
| `show: hash` | Each key's raw hash, under it |

Numbers go through `k mod m` and words through Java's `String.hashCode`, spelled
as the JDK spells it — a figure claiming to be a `HashMap` is one. Under open
addressing each key carries how many probes it cost and an arc runs from the
bucket it wanted to the one it settled for, which is the number the chaining
picture cannot show and the reason open addressing is taught at all.

To draw a table out of a book instead, write the buckets yourself and leave
`keys:` off:

```hash
buckets: 4
1: apple banana
3: cherry
```

You cannot do both. A computed table and a typed one would disagree, and the
computed one is the point.

### `bitfield` — a word, cut into its bits

```bitfield
s:1 sign
bexp:8 biased exponent
m:23 significand
```

One row a field: a short name for the box, how many bits it owns, and the long
name underneath it. Boxes are drawn to scale — the same convention every ISA
manual and RFC diagram already uses — with a floor under each one so a
one-bit field still fits its own letter.

| Directive | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `s:1 sign` | A field: id, bit count, name |
| `_:7` | Bits nothing uses — drawn hatched, not boxed |
| `width: 32` | Caps a row; the rest wraps onto the next |
| `title:` / `caption:` | A line above and a line below the figure |

```bitfield
width: 32
opcode:6 op
rs:5 source
rt:5 target
rd:5 dest
shamt:5 shift
funct:6 function
```

A `width:` directive caps how many bits fit on a row and wraps the rest onto
the next one, which is what a 32-bit-per-line protocol header needs and a
single register does not.

### `chart` — growth, predicted or measured

```chart
x: 1..40
mark: 14 n₀
f = 3n + 40
cg = n^2 / 4
```

Two figures in a course on algorithms are charts and nothing else will do. The
definition of big-O drawn out — `f(n)` under `c·g(n)` from some `n₀` onwards,
where the whole content is the crossing — and the one at the other end of the
subject: the times you actually measured, plotted against `n`, which is how you
find out that your `O(n log n)` sort has an `O(n²)` line in it. A series here is
either an expression or a row of numbers, and they draw the same way on the same
axes.

| Line or directive | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `n^2 / 4` | A curve, labelled with itself |
| `f = 3n + 40` | The same, named |
| `measured: 12 26 55` | Readings — drawn dashed, with dots |
| `x: 1..64` | The domain; or `x: 1 2 4 8` to name the points |
| `y: 0..500` | Fix the vertical range |
| `log: xy` | Logarithmic axes — `log: y` for one of them |
| `mark: 14 n₀` | A rule across, labelled |
| `bars:` | Bars rather than lines |
| `xlabel:` / `ylabel:` | Names the axes — x is `n` unless you say otherwise |

Juxtaposition is multiplication, because nobody writing about algorithms writes
`n * Math.log2(n)`: `2n`, `n log n` and `3n^2 log n` all parse as themselves.
`log` is base two with no way to change it — in this subject an unqualified log
has been base two for fifty years, and a plot that quietly drew the natural log
would be wrong by a constant factor in a picture whose whole subject is constant
factors. `ln`, `log2` and `log10` say so explicitly.

Curves are named at their right-hand end rather than in a legend, because a
legend makes you look away from the picture, match a colour and look back. On
log-log axes a polynomial is a straight line whose slope is its exponent, so
"is this quadratic or is it n log n" stops being an opinion about the shape of a
curve.

### `types` — classes, interfaces, and what extends what

```types
abstract class Animal
interface Winged
class Dog extends Animal
class Bird extends Animal implements Winged
```

The figure a design document opens with, written as the declarations it is a
picture of. One type a line:

| Written | Draws |
| --- | --- |
| `class Dog` | A plain box |
| `abstract class Animal` | The name in italics, `abstract class` under it |
| `interface Winged` | A dashed box — also `enum` and `record` |
| `class Dog extends Animal` | A solid edge up to `Animal` |
| `class Bird implements Winged` | A dashed edge — realising, not extending |
| `class Bird < Animal, Winged` | The short form: a subtype of both |
| *(indented under a type)* | Its fields and methods, in a compartment |

This is deliberately not a `tree`. A tree gives every node one parent, and a
hierarchy stops being a tree the moment it is worth drawing — `Bird` is under
both `Animal` and `Winged`. So a type names as many supertypes as it has, and
nothing in the source says where anything goes: a type sits one row below the
deepest thing it inherits from, and slides along that row to keep its edges
short and uncrossed. Add a type in the middle and the picture rearranges itself
instead of breaking.

The arrowhead is UML's hollow triangle and always points at the **supertype**,
so the figure says which way the relation runs without a legend. A class under
an interface is drawn dashed whether or not `implements` was written — it is the
only thing it could be doing. A supertype nothing declares is drawn as a plain
class, which is what makes `Dog < Animal` a two-box figure on its own, and what
makes a misspelt supertype arrive as a box of its own rather than as nothing.

```types
title: Ciphers
interface Cipher
  encrypt(String): String
  decrypt(String): String
abstract class Substitution implements Cipher
  alphabet: char[]
class Caesar extends Substitution
class Vigenere extends Substitution
  key: String
```

### `algo` — an algorithm, running

```algo
title: Bubble sort
array: 5 3 8 1 9
speed: 500
---
note Walk the pairs, swapping any out of order
compare 0 1
swap 0 1
compare 1 2
mark 4 sorted
```

A structure — `array:`, `stack:`, `queue:`, `list:`, or `bst:`/`heap:`/`level:`
for a traversal over a tree — then one step per line. Every step is a frame, and
the transport under the figure plays, steps and scrubs them.

| Step | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `compare i j` | Lights those slots for one frame |
| `swap i j` | Swaps them |
| `set i v` | Writes a value |
| `mark i sorted` | A lasting mark; `mark 0..3 done` for a span |
| `unmark i` / `unmark all` | Takes it off |
| `at lo 0` | A named pointer under a slot; `at lo off` removes it |
| `range 2 5` | A bracket over a span; `range window 2 5` labels it |
| `push v` / `pop` | And `enqueue` / `dequeue`, `insert i v`, `remove i` |
| `visit 7` | In a tree, addressed by the node's label |
| `note …` | The caption for this frame onward |

Frames are folded from the start rather than stored, so stepping backwards is
exact and the scrubber can land anywhere. Values keep their identity across
frames, which is what makes a swap *slide* — the point of watching a sort rather
than reading a table of its states.

Nothing plays until it is asked to. `autoplay: true` overrides that, `loop: true`
runs it round, and `speed:` is the milliseconds a frame is held.

Printing cannot play, so an `algo` block exports as a strip of stills — the
frames that carry a note, plus the ends — which is how a textbook prints one.

`stills:` asks for that strip on screen as well, and then you choose the frames:

```algo
array: 5 3 8 1 9 2
stills: 0 4 -1
---
range sorted 0 0
note On entry: b = 0, nothing is sorted
compare 0 1
swap 0 1
range sorted 0 1
note Held: 0..b is sorted, b..n is not
mark 0..5 sorted
range sorted 0 5
note On exit: b = n, so all of it is sorted
```

This is the loop invariant figure, and it is a still one on purpose. An
invariant is not an animation — it is three pictures, on entry, held, and on
exit, and the argument is what stayed true across them. A block with `stills:`
gets no transport, because the figure is not about time. Steps count from zero
and a negative one counts from the end, so `0 -1` is start and finish without
having to know how many steps you wrote; a bare `stills:` picks them the way
printing does.

### Asking Claude for one

Writing thirty steps out by hand is the reason most people never draw one of
these. **Animate an algorithm** in the command palette, or `/animated` in a
note, asks Claude for the whole run: name the algorithm, and the block appears
in the note immediately as a row of empty slots, with the request going on
behind it.

Nothing is blocked while it works. The placeholder is ordinary source —

```algo
pending: mtsr2tuc1
prompt: Selection sort over 7 2 9 4
```

— so it holds the space the figure will need, says what it is for, and is still
legible in another editor or after a restart. Keep writing underneath it; when
the answer lands it replaces exactly those lines, as one edit, with the caret
and the undo history where you left them. It goes to the note it was asked
from, so it is safe to move on to another one, and a request that fails leaves
the block behind with the reason and the prompt still in it rather than
vanishing.

A selection is context rather than the question: highlight your own quicksort,
ask for "this, on 7 2 9 4", and it animates what you highlighted.

### Shared annotations

After any label, in any of them: `*` rings it, `~` fades it, `#red` (also
green, blue, yellow, purple, gray) colours it from the theme's own palette, and
`| text` adds a second, smaller line. Ask Claude for one with **Structure** mode
in the Claude dialog.

## Canvas

An infinite board for the thinking that is not linear: cards you place yourself,
notes embedded as cards, and arrows between them. Drag from any edge of a card to
connect it; scroll to pan, `Cmd`-scroll to zoom.

It saves as a `.canvas` file in the vault in the **JSON Canvas** format
(jsoncanvas.org), which is the same format Obsidian uses — so a board made here
opens there, and vice versa. Anything in the file Stone does not understand is
carried through a save untouched rather than dropped.

Canvas is **hidden from the view bar by default**: it is a surface people either
live in or never open, and an unused tab costs everyone attention. Turn it on
under Settings › Appearance, or just press `Cmd 7`.

## Documents

PDFs are ordinary citizens, not a separate feature. Point Stone at a folder of
them — an iCloud folder, a Downloads folder, a papers directory — and they
appear in the sidebar under **Docs**, answer to `[[wikilinks]]`, turn up in
`Ctrl/Cmd K`, and **open in a pane exactly like a note**, so a paper and the
notes you are taking on it sit side by side in a split. Nothing is moved,
copied, or rewritten; a folder can instead be set to copy into the vault if you
would rather it stayed self-contained.

**Add folder** is in three places, and all three do the same thing: the Docs
tab in the sidebar when it is empty, the header of the `Cmd 8` gallery, and
Settings › Documents. Adding one saves it, scans it, and shows what it found —
a folder is never watched-but-unread.

There is no Documents tab, on purpose. A screen of their own would put documents
back in a box that the rest of the app has to reach into. `Cmd 8` still opens a
gallery for browsing the whole library and managing watched folders.

### What renders

PDFs, drawn with pdf.js onto a canvas in the pane. Stone does not implement a
PDF engine — it drives the one that already ships with the app, and falls back
to Chromium's own viewer in an iframe if a document defeats it, so a file that
will not render here is still readable rather than a blank pane.

Drawing the pages rather than embedding a viewer is what makes browsing Stone's
own: a rail down the side gives every page a preview, arrow keys, Home and End
work as you would expect, the page number is typeable, and the zoom control is a
real control rather than whatever the embedded viewer decided to expose. Page
previews are rendered lazily and one at a time, so a 300-page document is
navigable immediately instead of after every page has decoded.

Nothing else renders. An `.epub` in a watched folder is listed and searchable by
name; opening it hands it to whichever app owns it.

### What is searchable

Text is extracted so documents turn up in search alongside notes. Be clear about
the limits, because they decide whether a document is findable by anything other
than its name:

- **Scanned PDFs have no text and never will here.** There is no OCR.
- **Some fonts defeat extraction.** Text is read from the content streams,
  including the kerning that many producers use in place of actual spaces. Where
  a font maps glyphs through a private encoding the result is not language, and
  Stone indexes nothing rather than filling search with noise. Documents from
  LaTeX and most typesetters come out clean; some word processors produce text
  with characters dropped or words run together.
- **Only PDFs are read.** Any other file type in a watched folder is indexed by
  name alone.
- **An evicted iCloud file is not on the machine.** Reading one blocks while
  macOS downloads it — minutes, for a big file — so Stone never touches file
  contents during a scan. Evicted documents are listed, marked, and have a
  Download button.

## Themes and plugins

A **theme** is one `.css` file in the vault's theme folder, chosen in Settings;
snippets still stack on top of whichever theme is in force. One is replaced, the
others accumulate — which is the only real difference between them.

A **plugin** is a folder under `.stone/plugins` with a `manifest.json` and a
`main.js`:

```js
stone.addCommand({
  id: 'count',
  name: 'Count my notes',
  callback: async () => {
    const notes = await stone.vault.list()
    stone.notice(`You have ${notes.length} notes.`)
  }
})
```

Plugins do **not** run in Stone's window. Obsidian's run in its renderer with
full access to the DOM and to Node, which is why its ecosystem is so large and
why a malicious plugin there owns the machine. Stone's renderer is locked down —
`contextIsolation`, no `nodeIntegration`, and a CSP with `script-src 'self'` that
makes injected script a non-event — and widening that so third-party code could
be loaded into it would trade away the app's best security property for a
feature.

So a plugin runs in an offscreen window with no vault access, no network, and no
view of the interface. Everything it can actually do arrives back over IPC as a
small set of verbs, each checked against the permissions its manifest declared
and you approved when you switched it on. Ask to write without `vault-write` and
the call is refused.

The honest cost: a plugin cannot draw its own interface, because it has no DOM to
draw into. It can add commands, respond to events, and read and write notes.

## Known gaps

- Google Calendar is read-only, via ICS subscription. Two-way Google sync would
  need OAuth and a verified app.
- Recurring events from ICS feeds are expanded up to 2000 occurrences per
  series, which is a guard against malformed `RRULE`s rather than a real limit.
- The week view lays overlapping events on top of each other instead of
  side-by-side columns.
- Plugins cannot draw interface, by design. See **Themes and plugins**.
- Canvas has no multi-select marquee or undo of its own yet; deleting a card is
  the one destructive action and it takes the selection, not the board.
- There is still no mobile app. The vault is markdown in a synced folder, so
  Obsidian on a phone reads the notes — but not Stone's tasks or calendar.
- No column layouts. Notion's side-by-side blocks would need the editor to flow
  lines into two columns while they stay editable, which CodeMirror lays out one
  line at a time and cannot do; the alternative — a read-only widget you edit as
  source — needs a second markdown renderer inside the editor, and keeping two
  renderers in step is the thing this codebase most deliberately avoids.
- A URL is a link, not a preview card. Unfurling one means fetching the page,
  which is a network request per link from an app that otherwise makes none.
- Checkbox statuses are the four Stone models: `[ ]`, `[/]`, `[x]`, `[-]`. Extra
  ones like Obsidian's `[?]` would have to mean something to the Tasks view, the
  calendar and every query, so they are a data-model change rather than a
  formatting one.
