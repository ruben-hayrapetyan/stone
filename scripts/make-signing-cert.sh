# Create a self-signed code signing certificate for Stone.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# macOS records a TCC (privacy) grant against a *code requirement*, not against
# a bundle identifier. For an app with no signing certificate there is nothing
# stable to anchor to, so TCC pins the grant to the binary's cdhash:
#
#   cdhash H"4e58324696ef..." or cdhash H"d4aee92466..."
#
# The cdhash changes on every single build, so calendar access granted to one
# build is silently dead in the next one. Signing with a certificate — even a
# self-signed one — changes the recorded requirement to:
#
#   identifier "com.stone.app" and certificate leaf = H"<cert hash>"
#
# which is stable for as long as the certificate is, so the grant survives
# rebuilds and app updates.
#
# A real Apple Developer ID is still the right answer for public distribution
# (it also clears Gatekeeper and allows notarisation). This is the local
# stand-in: `scripts/sign-mac.mjs` prefers a Developer ID whenever one exists.
#
# Usage:  ./scripts/make-signing-cert.sh
# Undo:   security delete-certificate -c "Stone Local Signing"
