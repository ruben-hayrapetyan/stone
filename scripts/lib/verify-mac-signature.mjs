/**
 * Check that a packaged macOS app carries the signature it needs.
 *
 * "Signed" is not the bar. macOS records any TCC (privacy) grant against an
 * app's *designated requirement*, so a grant only survives a rebuild when
 * that requirement anchors to a certificate:
 *
 *   identifier "com.stone.app" and certificate root = H"…"   ← survives updates
 *   cdhash H"…"                                              ← dies with this binary
 *
 * Nothing in a normal build fails when it comes out the second way, which is
 * why these checks exist as a build step rather than as a habit. Stone does
 * not currently request any TCC-gated permission — REQUIRED_USAGE_KEYS is
 * empty for that reason — but the check stays wired up for whenever one is
 * added back.
