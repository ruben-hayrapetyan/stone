/**
 * Every kind of block a note can hold, described once.
 *
 * Stone's blocks are all the same thing on disk — three backticks and a word —
 * and completely different things to write. A `hash` block is six directives, a
 * `types` block is declarations, an `algo` block is a header and then a script
 * under a rule. Until now each of those was documented in the manual, seeded by
 * one entry in the slash menu, and understood by its own parser, with nothing
 * joining them up: the menu could not offer a second way into a fence, and
 * inside one there were no suggestions at all, because the editor's completion
 * knew about code and maths and treated everything else as a drawn box it had
 * no opinion about.
 *
 * This is that missing middle. One record per datatype holding three things:
 *
 *   presets    — starting points worth having, not just an empty fence
 *   keys/words — the vocabulary of the fence, for completion inside it
 *   docs       — where the manual explains it, to the section
 *
 * The slash menu, the in-block completion source and the **Explain this block**
 * command all read this table, which is what keeps them agreeing. A directive
 * added to a parser is added here in the same edit, and the menu, the
 * suggestion list and the manual link all learn about it at once.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* here is the grammar itself. This table knows the
 * name of a directive and one line about what it does; the parser in `viz/`
 * remains the only thing that knows what the value means. A completion list
 * that tried to validate would be a second, worse parser drifting from the
 * first.
