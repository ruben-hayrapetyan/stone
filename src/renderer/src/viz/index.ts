/**
 * Program figures: the fences, and the one call that draws them.
 *
 * `memory` for what the machine is holding, `boxes` for what refers to what,
 * `list` for the chain on its own, `tree` for the shapes that arrive as arrays,
 * `graph` for the ones that refused to be a tree, `types` for how a design is
 * put together, `hash` for the one structure whose picture has to be computed,
 * `chart` for growth — predicted or measured — `threads` for a schedule that
 * two correct threads should not have been allowed, `grammar` for a syntax
 * drawn as the track it is, `bitfield` for a word cut into the bits each part
 * of it owns, and `algo` for the ones that only make sense moving. They share
 * a house style, an error box, and this entry point, which is all the editor,
 * the print window and the exporter need to know about them.
 *
 * A figure that will not parse is never silently dropped. It comes back as a
 * dashed box saying which line it could not read, with the source still in it,
 * because the source is what the person wrote and losing it to a typo would be
 * the worst possible failure for something living inside their notes.
