/**
 * The manual, as data.
 *
 * Stone's feature surface is mostly *syntax* — a token in a checkbox, a key in
 * frontmatter, a word after three backticks — and syntax is the one kind of
 * documentation that is useless anywhere but next to the note you are writing.
 * Alt-tabbing to a README to remember whether a heap is `heap:` or `level:` is
 * how a fence stops getting used at all.
 *
 * So it lives in a panel, and it is structured rather than prose: a topic is a
 * list of sections, a section a list of blocks, and every code example carries
 * the exact text it would go into a note as. That shape buys three things a
 * page of markdown would not. The search box can match a heading, a paragraph
 * and the inside of an example separately and say which it hit. Every example
 * gets an Insert button, so reading how a `tree` block works and having one in
 * the note is a single click rather than a transcription. And nothing here can
 * drift out of sync with the panel that renders it, because there is only one
 * renderer.
 *
 * Inline markup in a `text` field is deliberately two things and no more:
 * `code` and **bold**. Anything that needs more structure than that is a block.
