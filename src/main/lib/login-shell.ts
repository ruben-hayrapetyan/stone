/**
 * The PATH the user's terminal has.
 *
 * An app launched from the Finder or the Start menu inherits launchd's PATH,
 * which has none of the places a version manager installs to. That bites twice.
 * Once when looking for a CLI, which is why `claude.ts` asks a login shell
 * where its binary is — and again after one is found, because
 * a CLI installed through npm is not a binary at all but a script starting
 * `#!/usr/bin/env node`. Spawn that with the app's own PATH and the kernel hands
 * it to `env`, which cannot find `node`, and the run dies with
 * `env: node: No such file or directory` before a line of it has run.
 *
 * So: ask the login shell for its PATH once, hand it to everything we spawn.
