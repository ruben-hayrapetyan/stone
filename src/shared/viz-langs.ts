/*
 * These names, and deliberately no aliases. `stack`, `heap`, `trace` and `uml`
 * all read as obvious synonyms and all of them are things people paste under a
 * fence for other reasons — a stack trace most of all, and PlantUML under
 * `uml` — and claiming a fence that was never meant for us turns someone's
 * pasted output into an error box. `plot` and `table` are missing for the same
 * reason: a `table` fence would swallow every pasted grid in the vault.
 *
 * `list` is claimed, on the other side of that same test: nothing prints under
 * it and no highlighter answers to it, so a fence tagged `list` in a vault was
 * always someone drawing a linked list by hand.
 *
 * `graph` is claimed on that same reading, and it is the one name here worth
 * arguing about, because `graph` is also Mermaid's own first word. But
 * Mermaid's *info string* is `mermaid`; its `graph` is a line inside the block,
 * where nothing here ever looks. Nothing pastes a fence tagged `graph`, and the
 * word is the one everybody reaches for. `threads` and `grammar` are unclaimed
 * by every highlighter and by every tool that prints — a fence tagged
 * `grammar` in a vault was somebody writing a grammar. `bitfield` is unclaimed
 * for the same reason and does not collide with `bits` or `bit`, which read
 * like plausible highlighter names even though none answers to them.
